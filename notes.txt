    this will be my first actual project,
    my initial idea is to learn how to pull data and use it
    so i can find out what anime are currently airing from the app

    I plan on working a bit on the basic html and functionality behind getting the data


- 1/12/23
    focusing on functionality behind getting data first
    i want to create a program that finds what anime have been called 'mid' the most in reviews using the anilist api
    made a lot of progress today, got the program to pull data from the anilist api and had to read a lot of documentation to understand the syntax of GraphQL but it was worth it
    one thing ive learned from actually getting data about airing anime is that what anime is airing doesnt correlate with this season's anime, because some anime have been airing 
    for decades, so I need to use the time library to get the current date and somehow use it in my program to prevent that

    finally got the getAnime function to return the proper anime, ones that are airing, started this year and are in this season, it took a lot of staring at the same code to try 
    understand the syntax and reading a lot of documentation but it was worth it
    now going to focus on organizing the data and displaying it

    having to deal with hundreds of entries will be overwhelming so I'll just focus on organizing the data for one anime then scale it later
    
    began working on getting the actual site for the app using flask

- 1/14/23
    took a bunch of code from a tutorial about flask and now have a website
    need to figure out how to get the data on the website though

    in the future i will definetely learn a framework, as being good in a niche like specific framework is strong
    for this project im not sure if i really want to learn a framework like django

    going to display the ten most popular shows this season to avoid an 
    endless stream of shows

    actually going to make it so the website takes in user input, season and year and will return the ten most popular shows from that time

    when you go on anilist and select which year you want to filter by 
    does it load a new website or just update the elements on the html?

    my plan is to take user input with the <form> element in html then 


- 1/15/23
    after a bunch of debugging I got the website to take user input and return the correct anime info according
    to the year and season inputted

- 1/16/23
    I think I'll keep journaling my programming journey as I think in the future being able to look back at my progress will be a really rewarding feeling
    gonna make a new repo for notes 
    will keep taking notes on this project in this file

-1/18/23
    Added cool css and organized the html to decorate and tidy up the site, actually looks presentable now and took inspiration from Anilist's website
    At a point where I feel like the project is complete, of course I could add more but this is essentially what I wanted, Im gonna add extra info like episodes and studio though
