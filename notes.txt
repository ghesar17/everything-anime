    this will be my first actual project,
    my initial idea is to learn how to pull data and use it
    so i can find out what anime are currently airing from the app

    I plan on working a bit on the basic html and functionality behind getting the data

    focusing on functionality behind getting data first
    i want to create a program that finds what anime have been called 'mid' the most in reviews using the anilist api
