    this will be my first actual project,
    my initial idea is to learn how to pull data and use it
    so i can find out what anime are currently airing from the app

    I plan on working a bit on the basic html and functionality behind getting the data

    focusing on functionality behind getting data first
    i want to create a program that finds what anime have been called 'mid' the most in reviews using the anilist api
    made a lot of progress today, got the program to pull data from the anilist api and had to read a lot of documentation to understand the syntax of GraphQL but it was worth it
    one thing ive learned from actually getting data about airing anime is that what anime is airing doesnt correlate with this season's anime, because some anime have been airing 
    for decades, so I need to use the time library to get the current date and somehow use it in my program to prevent that

    finally got the getAnime function to return the proper anime, ones that are airing, started this year and are in this season, it took a lot of staring at the same code to try 
    understand the syntax and reading a lot of documentation but it was worth it
    now going to focus on organizing the data and displaying it

    having to deal with hundreds of entries will be overwhelming so I'll just focus on organizing the data for one anime then scale it later
    
    began working on getting the actual site for the app using flask

    took a bunch of code from a tutorial about flask and now have a website
    need to figure out how to get the data on the website though
